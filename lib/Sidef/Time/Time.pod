=head1 NAME

Sidef::Time::Time

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class represents a point in time as Unix epoch seconds, providing methods to retrieve the current time, convert to local or GMT representations, and obtain high-resolution timestamps.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

var obj = Time()           # current time
var obj = Time(1234567890) # specific Unix timestamp


=head1 INHERITS

Inherits methods from: 

       * Sidef::Object::Object

=head1 METHODS

=head2 dump

    self. dump

Returns a String representation of the Time object in the format C<Time(seconds)>, useful for debugging and serialization.

=cut

=head2 gmt

    self. gmt

Returns a Date object representing this time in GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) / UTC timezone. 

Aliases:  I<gmtime>

=cut

=head2 local

    self.local

Returns a Date object representing this time in the local timezone. 

Aliases: I<localtime>

=cut

=head2 micro

    self.micro

Returns the current time as a Number with microsecond precision, using high-resolution timing.

Aliases: I<micro_sec>, I<micro_seconds>

=cut

=head2 new

    self.new
    self.new(seconds)

Creates a new Time object.  If C<seconds> is provided, it uses that value as the Unix epoch timestamp; otherwise, it uses the current time. 

Aliases: I<call>

=cut

=head2 now

    self.now

Returns the current Unix epoch time as a Number.

=cut

=head2 sec

    self.sec

Returns the Unix epoch seconds of this Time object as a Number. 

Aliases: I<time>

=cut

=head2 to_s

    self.to_s

Returns the Unix epoch seconds of this Time object as a String.

Aliases: I<to_str>

=cut

Sidef - The Sidef programming language.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Sidef is a modern, high-level, general-purpose programming language, inspired by Ruby, Raku and Go.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Sidef;

    my $sidef = Sidef->new(
                           name => 'test',       # name of the program
                           opt  => {},           # command-line options
                           parser_opt => {},     # parser options
                          );

    # Sidef code
    my $code = 'say "1 + 2 = #{1 + 2}"';

    # Execute the code
    $sidef->execute_code($code);

    # Compile the code to Perl
    my $perl = $sidef->compile_code($code, 'Perl');

    # Parse the Sidef code into an AST
    my $ast = $sidef->parse_code($code);

    # Optimize the AST by performing constant-folding
    my $oast = $sidef->optimize_ast($ast);

    # Compile the AST back into Sidef code
    print $sidef->compile_ast($oast, 'Sidef');


=head1 SUBROUTINES/METHODS

=head2 new

    my $s = Sidef->new(name => '...');

Creates a new Sidef object and returns it.

=head2 parse_code

    my $ast = $s->parse_code($code);

Parses a given Sidef code and returns the AST.

=head2 optimize_ast

    my $oast = $s->optimize_ast($ast);

Performs constant-folding and some other optimizations on a given AST.

Returns a new optimized AST.

=head2 compile_ast

    my $ccode = $s->compile_ast($ast, $backend);

Compiles the AST into code and returns it.

Valid values for the backend are: C<'Sidef'>, C<'Perl'>.

=head2 compile_code

    my $ccode = $s->compile_code($code, $backend)

Parses and compiles the given Sidef code into target code and
returns it.

Valid values for the backend are: C<'Sidef'>, C<'Perl'>.

=head2 execute_code

    my $result = $s->execute_code($code);

Parses, compiles and executes a given Sidef code and returns
the result of the last statement.

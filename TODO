TODO list for Sidef

Classes:
    * Implement roles (from Perl 6) and add the `does` trait for classes
      (http://doc.perl6.org/language/objects#Roles)

Method/functions:
    * Implement the `is exported` trait for functions and classes (maybe)

New built-in classes:
    * Implement a native `Matrix` class (as `Sidef::Types::Array::Matrix`) with functionality close to that of the `Math::Matrix` Perl module.
    * Implement a native `Vector` class (as `Sidef::Types::Array::Vector`) with appropriate methods, such as: `dist`, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc...
    * Implement a native `Set` class (as `Sidef::Types::Set::Set`) with appropriate methods, such as: `contains`, `remove`, `union`, `intersect`, etc...
    * Implement a native `Bag` class (as `Sidef::Types::Set::Bag`) which would behave exactly like a multiset.

New built-in methods:
    * Implement the Number `seed` and `iseed` methods, which would re-seed the pseudorandom number generator.

Perl:
    * Switch to subroutine `signatures` (as soon as this feature becomes stable).

Speculations:
    * Make all core methods (including user-defined methods) real multimethods, using Class::Multimethods.
    * Replace the current numerical system with Math::BigNum.
    * Bootstrap Sidef by writing a code generator in Sidef that generates Perl code.
    * Rewrite all core libraries in Sidef.
